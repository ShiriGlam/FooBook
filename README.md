first, we write htmls for the screens and build basic logic for the application... and after I transferred all the code to the structure of react application, build the components and continue to develop the application and added the required features, mainly work on the home page and switching between the screens, the login page and the registration page.
also wrote tests for the home page and tests for the login page. A total of 6 tests.
# run the code:
In order to run the code: npm install npm start

# Capabilities of the web application:
 You can request a friend from any user by the button on his post, after which the user from whom we asked for friends can see the list of all friend requests that have asked him by clicking on "friend requests". for example:
 ![alt text](<צילום מסך 2024-04-10 182740.png>)
 
 ![alt text](<צילום מסך 2024-04-10 182749.png>)

  When you click on "Friends" above, you can see the list of all members. for example:
  ![alt text](<צילום מסך 2024-04-10 182804.png>)
  
   And when we click on a friend, you can see all of their posts. for example:
   ![alt text](<צילום מסך 2024-04-10 182833.png>)
   
   The search button also works and you can search for users and when we find a user you can ask him for a friend, if he is already a friend, you will be able to see his posts. for example:
   ![alt text](<צילום מסך 2024-04-10 182713.png>)
